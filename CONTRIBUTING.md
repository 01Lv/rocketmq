## How To Contribute

We are always very happy to have contributions, whether for trivial cleanups or big new features. We want to have high quality, well documented codes for each programming language. Nor is code the only way to contribute to the project. We strongly value documentation and gladly accept improvements to the documentation.
Contributing code

To submit a change for inclusion, please do the following:
If the change is non-trivial please include some unit tests that cover the new functionality.

If you are introducing a completely new feature or API it is a good idea to start a wiki and get consensus on the basic design first.

It is our job to follow up on patches in a timely fashion. Nag us if we aren't doing our job (sometimes we drop things).

## Becoming a Committer

We are always interested in adding new contributors. What we look for are series of contributions, good taste and ongoing interest in the project. If you are interested in becoming a committer, please let one of the existing committers know and they can help you walk through the process.
